The Rizal family was known for their wealth and prominence in Calamba, Laguna. During their time, they were regarded as one of the largest and most influential families, enjoying a life of ease and affluence. They were considered part of the <strong>principalia</strong> class, the ruling elite of their town. José Rizal was born into a family of thirteen, including his mother Teodora Alonso Realonda and father Don Francisco Mercado II. He had one brother, Paciano, and nine sisters: Saturnina (the eldest), Olympia, Lucia, Narcisa, Maria, Concepcion, Josefa, Soledad (the youngest), and others. The family’s status and resources provided Rizal with opportunities for education and social standing that later shaped his role as a national hero.

According to some accounts, his mother nearly died during his delivery due to his unusually large head. Three days after his birth, on June 22, 1861, Rizal was baptized at the Catholic Church of Calamba by parish priest Rev. Rufino Collantes, receiving the name Jose Rizal Mercado. </p>
                        <p style="color: #a16207; text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 1rem; line-height: 1.6;"> During 1865-1867, his mother taught him how to
read and write. At the age of three, Rizal mastered and
learned the alphabet taught by his mother. At a very
young age, he has shown great interest in reading. He
enjoyed reading books in their library at home, with his
mother who acts as his reading teacher and a critic. At this
time, he also learned how to pray and even read the bible. </p>
                                        <p style="color: #a16207; text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 1rem; line-height: 1.6;"> When Jose Rizal grew older, his parents acquired
private tutors to give him lessons at home in preparation
for his formal education. One of them was Leon Monroy,
a classmate of his father who taught him the rudiments of
Latin. At about this time, his mother’s cousin, Uncle Manuel
Alberto, who frequently visited the family in Calamba, was
worried about his nephew’s physical development. He
then taught Rizal to develop the skills in swimming,
fencing, wrestling and other sports, while Uncle Jose
taught him to love and admire the beauty of nature.
On the other hand, Uncle Gregorio, a scholar, has
instilled in Rizal’s mind the love for education and its importance, the value of hard
work, to think for himself, and to observe his surroundings carefully</p>
                                                        <p style="color: #a16207; text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 1rem; line-height: 1.6;"> When he was four years old, his sister Concepcion, the eighth child in the
Rizal family, died at the age of three. This was the first time he cried as a young boy.
As sad as he was, the parish priest of Calamba, Father Leoncio Lopez, helped Rizal
understand the philosophy of life and learned the value of scholarship and
intellectual honesty.
Rizal, in his childhood, used to take long rides through all the surrounding
country by riding his pony that his father gave him. Among his pets were doves and
a dog.</p>
                                                                        <p style="color: #a16207; text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 1rem; line-height: 1.6;">Owing to the continuous teaching of Doña Teodora, Rizal was persuaded
to express his feelings through verses. He was able to write his first poem when he
was eight years old. The poem was entitled “Sa Aking Mga Kababata” (To My Fellow
Children), which showed that Rizal, even at a young age, already had love for his
country. Here, he similarly incorporates the love for the native language with God’s
gift of freedom. He compared his native language or Tagalog to Latin, English and
Spanish. Tagalog, like any other languages, had its own alphabet and system
writing, which according to Rizal, disappeared because they were neglected or
ignored. With this, he encourages his fellow children to love their native tongue.</p>

Kapagka ang baya’y sadyang umiibig<br>
Sa langit salitang kaloob ng langit<br>
Sanlang kalayaan nasa ring masapi<br><br>

Katulad ng ibong nasa himpapawid<br>
Pagka’t ang salita’y isang kahatulan<br>
Sa bayan, sa nayo't mga kaharian<br><br>

At ang isang tao’y katulad, kabagay<br>
Ng alin mang likha noong kalayaan.<br>
Ang hindi magmahal sa kanyang salita<br>
Mahigit sa hayop at malansang isda<br><br>

Kaya ang marapat pagyamanin kusa<br>
Na tulad sa inang tunay na nagpala<br>
Ang wikang Tagalog tulad din sa Latin,<br><br>

Sa Ingles, Kastila, at salitang anghel,<br>
Sapagkat ang Poong maalam tumingin<br>
Ang siyang naggagawad, nagbibigay sa atin.<br>
Ang salita nati’y tulad din sa iba<br><br>

Na may alfabeto at sariling letra,<br>
Na kaya nawala’y dinatnan ng sigwa<br>
Ang lunday sa lawa noong dakong una.

After Rizal’s tutor Leon Monroy died, his parents decided to transfer Rizal to a private school in Biñan, Laguna. He was accompanied by his older brother Paciano, who acted as his second father during his school days in Biñan. The school was then supervised by Maestro Justiniano Aquino Cruz.<br><br>

Rizal’s first day of class in the school was not easy. The maestro asked him if he knew how to speak Latin or Spanish, but in response, he only knew a little of the languages. As a result, one of his classmates named Pedro, the son of the maestro, laughed at him. Pedro was always bullying him that it eventually resulted in a brawl.<br><br>

But knowing Rizal’s acquired knowledge and skill in the art of wrestling from his Tio Manuel, he defeated Pedro. After the said incident, Rizal became popular in his class. Here, Rizal was able to show his intellectual superiority.

Here, Rizal was able to show his intellectual superiority. He excelled in his class in Latin, Spanish, and other subjects in the curriculum for elementary pupils. Because of this, many of the students became jealous of him and did everything to destroy Rizal’s name to Maestro Cruz. While Rizal’s interest in painting was nurtured early on by an old painter named Juancho of Biñan. During this time, knowledge was taught in the minds of the students by doing tedious memorization methods. Despite some lack of the elementary education in the Spanish system, Rizal was able to have the needed instruction preparatory for college work in Manila.
